An application/programming test to be a consultant
with RedPoint Technologies (http://www.redpointtech.com/).

See RedpointChallenge.pdf included in this project
for a description of the programming problem.

I got the job...

PS - There is a logic problem with the Challenge
which occasionally pops up. I was the first
respondent to spot this problem and tell RedPoint.
